//===-- Blog / ~5min read --=======================================================\\
||                                                                                  ||
||      Hey there! Welcome to my first 'blog' post. Why did I make it? To 'reveal'? ||
|| Now if you don't know why, you might think I'm some angry white man since        ||
|| they suspended my account or didn't reply to my tweet asking for support fast    ||
|| enough. < None of those reasons are 'mine'. Canva, duped me. Well at least what  ||
|| I believe is the case. It started with my friend; John telling me about Canva's  ||
|| Bug Bounty and how many things are in scope, etc. Basic stuff. So naturally, I   ||
|| going the easiest way for at least a P2 bug: the Canva Chrome Extension. To my   ||
|| lets call it.... dismay. I couldn't even get its source for some reason. So I go ||
|| back and of course *.canva.com is in scope. So I try the login page, sure I'll   ||
|| get something, right? Well, I did. If you disable JavaScript, plop random creds  ||
|| into the fields, and hit 'Login', you get access to a random account, One even   ||
|| had 10 Canva credits!                                                            ||
||                                                                                  ||
||     It was at thia time I was convinced to use BugCrowd. I made an account wrote ||
|| a report and hit 'Submit'. A few hours later they reply they were unable to      ||
|| replicate the issue. Well that was suspicious, my replication instructions were  ||
|| very clear! Here they are by the way:                                            ||
||                                                                                  ||
||    1. Use Apple's Safari Browser                                                 ||
||    2. Disable JavaScript via Develop > Disable JavaScript                        ||
||    3. Go to the Canva Login Page ['https://www.canva.com/login']                 ||
||    4. Enter any credentials for the Email and Password fields                    ||
||    5. Click 'Login'. On Safari; it is not grayed-out. On other browsers, it is.  ||
||    Observe that you will be logged into a seemingly random account every-time, - ||
||    performing a full Account Takeover.                                           ||
||                                                                                  ||
||      Seems pretty clear, doesn't it? Well I reply with some additional details.  ||
|| I resolved their blocker and I thought that was the end of it. It wasn't.        ||
|| Again, they came back, (this time a different 'team' member) stating the same.   ||
||                                                                                  ||
||      I try my bug again. This time I get a Error 400. Whew, its fixed. But then, ||
|| I thought about it. Errors, like these, don't fix themselves. Unless I'm insane, ||
|| Someone had to of fixed it. And I reported it. They quite frankly lied about     ||
|| not being able to replicate it to fix it quietly. I didn't even report it for    ||
|| the money ($4,500 - $6,000) ! Now I'm not releasing my *entire* report or their  ||
|| replies to me on BugCrowd, YET. They're "contacting the appropriate team" and    ||
|| I want to see what they formulate. This is the end, to be continued. Peace,      ||
||                                                                                  ||
||                                                                                  ||
||     - SOURFRUIT                                                                  ||
||                                                                                  ||
